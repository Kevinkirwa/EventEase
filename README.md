Summary of Copilot Assistance
​Throughout the development of EventEase, Microsoft Copilot acted as a pair programmer and debugger:
​Code Generation: In Activity 1, I used Copilot to scaffold the EventCard.razor component. I prompted it to "Create a Blazor card component with input fields bound to an Event model," which saved me time writing the HTML boilerplate.
​Debugging: In Activity 2, when my routing wasn't working (I was getting 404 errors), I pasted the error into Copilot. It correctly identified that I was missing the @page directive at the top of my Razor components.
​Optimization: In Activity 3, Copilot suggested using EditForm and DataAnnotations for the registration page instead of manual if/else checks for validation, making the code cleaner and more robust.# EventEase
